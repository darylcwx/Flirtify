Flirtify is a microservice-based application that aims to connect individuals based on their interests and compatibility. The app provides a platform for users to find potential matches, swipe on them, message them, and report any inappropriate behaviour.
In this app, users can:
Browse through a list of compatible users and swipe left or right on them to indicate interest.
Swipe right on users to indicate interest, which creates a match between them. Should both users swipe right on each other, they can start to message each other.
Users can also report any inappropriate behaviour from other users to ensure a safe and respectful community.
